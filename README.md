# TIME---SERIES-FORECASTING

📊 Time Series Forecasting – Task 4
🔍 Repository Overview
This repository contains a complete implementation of Time Series Forecasting, demonstrating how to analyze, model, and predict sequential data over time. The notebook guides you through key stages of working with time series — from preprocessing to modeling and evaluation — using Python and popular data science libraries.

🧠 Project Objectives
Understand time series data characteristics

Perform trend, seasonality, and noise decomposition

Prepare data using rolling windows, lags, and differencing

Apply forecasting models:

Statistical methods (ARIMA, SARIMA)

Machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost)

Deep learning models (LSTM, GRU) (if included)

Visualize forecasts and evaluate accuracy using metrics like MAE, RMSE, MAPE
